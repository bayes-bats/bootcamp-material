## Goals for the Afternoon

-   Consider learning objectives and goals for a regression modeling lab

-   Identify interesting data to use in a simple linear regression lab (sleep study data can be used as backup)

-   Write lab prompts and solutions for class!

## Sample Lab Materials

-   Take 15 minutes to review the exercises on humidity and penguins in [section 9.10.2 of Bayes Rules!  ](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-9.html#exercises-8) . Start making notes about what types of questions  you want your students to address, and think about possible data sets for analysis. Be prepared to share one primary concept you would like your students to encounter in the lab.

-   Full group: sharing

-   Small groups: based on topical interests, split into groups and develop lab activities!
