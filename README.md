# Bootcamp material

Repo to prepare bootcamp material: lectures, discussions and activities.

Lectures and discussions are supported by slides. 
Activities are supported by notebooks with table of contents.

### Templates

The folder **templates** contains two useful files:

  - [slides-template.qmd](templates/slides-template.qmd): showcases examples of elements you may want to include in your slides, from essential elements (e.g., bullet points, code chunks, math formulas) to common elements (e.g., tables, images) to more special ones (e.g., tabsets, callouts). 
  
  - [activity-template.qmd](templates/activity-template.qmd): showcases examples of elements you may want to include in your activity notebook. _This is not ready yet._
  
### Structure

Here is how this repo is organized:

- Each bootcamp day (including the imaginary "day 0") has its folder.

- Each bootcamp-day part (2 lectures, 1 discussion and 1 activity) has a subfolder containing the supporting material (slides or notebook) and its related files.

- The supporting material files have been named and given a title following the [tentative workshop schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_O29RwYSeenWwy9O6EC67uWRQGO6DICwlwMM9kMmqhk/edit#gid=0).
