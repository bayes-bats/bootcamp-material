## Goals for the Afternoon

-   Brainstorm ideas for questions to answer using a Bayesian analysis
  -   For today, avoid regression models (coming soon!) and stick with analysis using simple one or two-parameter models

-   Develop an activity that could be used in a course you teach
  -   Be creative!
  -   Can also follow example from this morning if desired
  
-   Identify data and develop code for modeling
