# Introduction: Observations in Groups

## Recap: The Normal Model \& Normal Regression

- When you have continuous outcomes, you can use a normal model:
\begin{equation*}
Y_i \mid \mu, \sigma \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} \textrm{Normal}(\mu, \sigma), \,\,\, i = 1, \cdots, n.
\end{equation*}

- When you have predictor variables available, $\{x_{i1}, \cdots, x_{ip}\}$; you can specify an observation specific mean:
\begin{equation*}
Y_i \mid \mu_i, \sigma \overset{ind}{\sim} \textrm{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma), \,\,\, i = 1, \cdots, n,
\end{equation*}
where 
\begin{equation*}
\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \cdots, \beta_p x_{ip}.
\end{equation*}
- Observations are assumed independent.

## When Observations Are Not Necessarily Independent

::: nonincremental
- Observations can be dependent in several ways

- Observations are nested in groups:
    - Studentsâ€™ test scores from multiple schools
    - Ratings of movies of different genres
    - Ratings of dramas of different schedules
    - Death rates of hospitals

## Discussion question
Can you think of additional examples of observations in groups?

::: nonincremental
- We will focus on a movie rating dataset to explore modeling approaches for dependent data

# Example: Ratings of Animation Movies

## Ratings of Animation Movies

- Example from [Chapter 10.2 of Probability and Bayesian Modeling book](https://bayesball.github.io/BOOK/bayesian-hierarchical-modeling.html#hierarchical-normal-modeling)

- MovieLens: personalized movie recommendation for users

- In one study, a sample on movie ratings for 8 animation movies released in 2010, total 55 ratings

- Each rating is for a movie completed by a user; some movies have many ratings while others have few

- A natural grouping of these 55 ratings: by movie title

## Plot of Ratings by Title

## Code

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

MovieRatings <- read.csv("2010_animation_ratings.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

MovieRatings %>%
  mutate(Title = as.character(title),
         Title = recode(Title,
                  "Shrek Forever After (a.k.a. Shrek: The Final Chapter) (2010)" = "Shrek Forever",
                  "How to Train Your Dragon (2010)" = "Dragon",
                  "Toy Story 3 (2010)" = "Toy Story 3",
                  "Tangled (2010)" = "Tangled",
                  "Despicable Me (2010)" = "Despicable Me",
                  "Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole (2010)" = "Guardians",
                  "Megamind (2010)" = "Megamind",
                  "Batman: Under the Red Hood (2010)" = "Batman")) ->
           MovieRatings
```

## Modeling Challenges

- Approach 1 - separate estimates for each movie $j$:
\begin{equation*}
Y_{1j}, \cdots, Y_{n_j j} \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} \textrm{Normal}(\mu_j, \sigma_j)
\end{equation*}
    - No relation among groups; groups with small sample size might suffer (e.g., $n_j = 1$)

- Approach 2 - combined estimates for all $J$ movies:
\begin{equation*}
Y_{ij} \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} \textrm{Normal}(\mu, \sigma)
\end{equation*}
    - Differences in groups are ignored

## Potential Solutions

- Something in between - hierarchical/multilevel modeling
    - Pooling information across groups
    - Achieved through a two-stage prior

# A Hierarchical Model with Random $\sigma$

## The Sampling Model

::: nonincremental
- Without loss of generality, assume a group-specific normal model for movie $j$:
\begin{eqnarray}
Y_{ij} \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} \textrm{Normal}(\mu_j, \sigma)
\end{eqnarray}
where $i = 1, \cdots, n_j$ and $n_j$ is the number of observations in group $j$

- Model parameters: $\{\mu_1, \cdots, \mu_J, \sigma\}$
:::

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Discussion question
Is a commonly shared $\sigma$ reasonable? If not, what can you do?
:::

## A Two-Stage Prior for $\{\mu_1, \cdots, \mu_J\}$: Stage 1

- All movies are animation movies, we could assume that the mean ratings are similar across movies

- First stage: the same normal prior distribution for each mean $\mu_j$
\begin{equation}
\mu_j \mid \mu, \tau \sim \textrm{Normal}(\mu, \tau)
\end{equation}

- This prior allows information pooled across movies (groups)
    - If $\tau$ is large, the $\mu_j$'s are very different a priori $\rightarrow$ modest pooling in parameter estimation
    - If $\tau$ is small, the $\mu_j$'s are very similar a priori $\rightarrow$ large pooling in parameter estimation

- $\mu$ and $\tau$: hyperparameters, and treated random

## A Two-Stage Prior for $\{\mu_1, \cdots, \mu_J\}$: Stage 2

- Second stage: weakly informative hyperpriors for hyperparameters
\begin{eqnarray}
\mu &\sim& \textrm{Normal}(3, 1) \\
\tau &\sim& \textrm{Cauchy}(0, 1)
\end{eqnarray}

- After posterior inference:
    - The posterior of $\mu$ is informative about an average mean rating
    - The posterior of $\tau$ is informative about the variation among the $\mu_j$'s

## Discussion question
Describe how the graphical representation corresponds to the hierarchical model. What parameters/hyperparameters are shared among what?
