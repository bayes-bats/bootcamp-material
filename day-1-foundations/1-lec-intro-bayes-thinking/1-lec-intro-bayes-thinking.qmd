## Interpretation of Probability

**Bayesian**: a probability measures the relative plausibility of an event.

**Frequentist**: a probability measures the long-run relative frequency of a repeatable event. In fact, “frequentists” are so named because of their interpretation of probability as a long-run relative frequency.



## Prior Data

Consider two claims. 

(1) Kaya claims that they can predict the outcome of a coin flip. To test their claim, you flip a fair coin 10 times and they correctly predicts all 10! 

(2) Fan claims that they can distinguish natural and artificial sweeteners. To test their claim, you give them 10 sweetener samples and they correctly identify each! In light of these experiments, what do you conclude?

a. You’re more confident in Fan’s claim than Kaya’s claim.

b. The evidence supporting Kaya’s claim is just as strong as the evidence supporting Fan’s claim.



## Hypothesis Testing

Suppose that during a recent doctor’s visit, you tested positive for a very rare disease. If you only get to ask the doctor one question, which would it be?

a. What’s the chance that I actually have the disease?  
b. If in fact I don’t have the disease, what’s the chance that I would’ve gotten this positive test result?

. . .

$P(\text{disease} | +)$ is a mathematical expression of question (a), and $P(+ | \text{disease}^c)$ expresses (b).



## Notes on Bayesian History

- Named after Thomas Bayes (1701-1761)


- Frequentist statistics is more popular; Bayesian statistics is surging in popularity 


- Computing, computing, computing


- It is harder to adopt to newer methods. Change is happening slowly. 



- We can embrace subjectivity.

# Review of Probability

## How Good is a Mammogram?

|         | Cancer | No Cancer | Total[^1] |
|---------|-------:|----------:|----------:|
| Mammo + | 85     |    990    |   1075   |
| Mammo - | 15     |   8910    |  8925   |
| Total   | 100    |     9900  |   10000    |

Let $A$ represent the event a mammogram is positive for breast cancer (Mammo +), and let $B$ represent the event that a woman has cancer.

## How Good is a Mammogram?

|         | Cancer | No Cancer | Total |
|---------|-------:|----------:|----------:|
| Mammo + | 85     |    990    |   1075   |
| Mammo - | 15     |   8910    |  8925   |
| Total   | 100    |     9900  |   10000    |

$$P(\text{Cancer})= ~?$$
$$P(\text{Cancer and Mammo +})= ~?$$
$$P(\text{Cancer given Mammo +})= ~?$$

. . .

Calculate these probabilities and express them using the notation for events $A$ and $B$.

## Marginal Probability

|         | Cancer | No Cancer | Total |
|---------|-------:|----------:|----------:|
| Mammo + | 85     |    990    |   1075   |
| Mammo - | 15     |   8910    |  8925   |
| Total   | **100**    |     9900  |   **10000**    |

$P(\text{Cancer})= ~?$

. . . 

$P(B) = \frac{100}{10000}= 0.01$

. . . 

$P(B^C)$ is called **complement** of event $B$ and represents the probability of selecting someone who does not have cancer.  

. . . 

$P(B)$ represents a **marginal probability**. So do $P(B^C)=1-P(B)$, $P(A)$, and $P(A^C)$. We can calculate these quantities using only the values in the margins of the contingency table.

## Conditional Probability

|         | Cancer | No Cancer | Total |
|---------|-------:|----------:|----------:|
| Mammo + | **85**     |    990    |   **1075**   |
| Mammo - | 15     |   8910    |  8925   |
| Total   | 100    |     9900  |   10000    |


$P(\text{Cancer given Mammo +})= ~?$

. . . 

$P(B \mid A) = \frac{85}{1075}= 0.079$

. . .

$P(B \mid A)$ is a **conditional probability**.  So are $P(B^C \mid A)=1-P(B \mid A)$, $P(B \mid A^C)$, $P(B^c \mid A^C)$, $P(A \mid B)$, etc. To calculate these probabilities, we focus on the row or column of the given information, *reducing* our sample space to that only of the given information. Note that $P(B \mid A) \neq P(A \mid B)$ - order matters.

## Joint Probability

|         | Cancer | No Cancer | Total |
|---------|-------:|----------:|----------:|
| Mammo + | **85**     |    990    |   1075   |
| Mammo - | 15     |   8910    |  8925   |
| Total   | 100    |     9900  |   **10000**    |

$P(\text{Cancer and Mammo +})= ~?$

. . . 

$P(B \cap A) = \frac{85}{10000}= 0.0085$

. . . 

$P(B \cap A)$ represents a **joint probability**. So do $P(B^C \cap A)$, $P(B \cap A^C)$, etc. 

. . . 

Note that $P(A \cap B)=P(B \cap A)$. Order does not matter here.

# Bayes' Rule for Events

## Breast Cancer Screening

|         | Cancer | No Cancer | Total |
|---------|-------:|----------:|----------:|
| Mammo + | 85     |    990    |   1075   |
| Mammo - | 15     |   8910    |  8925   |
| Total   | 100    |     9900  |   10000    |

Suppose a 40 year old woman, Maya, goes to a clinic for a screening mammogram.  The **prevalence** of breast cancer among women in this age group is 1%. We can think of this as **prior** information about whether Maya has breast cancer.

## Breast Cancer Screening

Maya has the screening mammogram and receives a positive finding.  Taking this new data into account, which of the following describes your **posterior** understanding of the probability that Maya has breast cancer?

a. These tests yield false positives all the time.  Let's see what happens at the next screening mammogram in a couple years.
b. The chances Maya has cancer have risen, but it is still much more likely that she is cancer-free than that she has cancer. Still, she should follow the recommendation of the doctor for follow-up diagnostic testing so that she doesn't miss the opportunity for early treatment just in case.
c. The chances Maya has cancer are very high. She should have follow-up testing as soon as possible and start thinking about treatment.

## The Prior Model

| Quantity | $B$ | $B^C$ | Sum |
|:-----|------:|------:|-----:|
| prior probability | 0.01 | 0.99 | 1 |

## Likelihood

Let's go back at the table and calculate the probability of a positive mammogram result (event $A$) in two cases: when a woman has cancer (event $B$), and when a woman does not have cancer (event $B^C$).

## Likelihood Mammo + When Cancer is Present

|         | **Cancer** | No Cancer | Total |
|---------|-------:|----------:|----------:|
| Mammo + | **85**     |    990    |   1075   |
| Mammo - | 15     |   8910    |  8925   |
| Total   | **100**    |     9900  |   10000    |

When a woman has cancer, we expect the screening mammogram to be positive with probability $P(A \mid B)=\frac{85}{100}=0.85$. This quantity is also called the **sensitivity** of the mammogram. We like our tests to have high sensitivity, picking up most of the cancers that are present.  




## Likelihood Mammo + When Cancer is Not Present

|         | Cancer | **No Cancer** | Total |
|---------|-------:|----------:|----------:|
| Mammo + | 85     |    **990**    |   1075   |
| Mammo - | 15     |   8910    |  8925   |
| Total   | 100    |     **9900**  |   10000    |

When a woman has no cancer, we expect the screening mammogram to be positive with probability $P(A \mid B^C)=\frac{990}{9900}=0.10$. A related quantity, $1-P(A \mid B^C)=P(A^C \mid B^C)=0.90$, is called the **specificity** of the mammogram.  We also want specificity to be high, so that women without cancer are told they are cancer-free and do not need to go through additional follow up.

## Likelihoods

We can call these quantities **likelihoods**, as they compare the likelihood of a positive mammogram under the two scenarios. Note $L(\cdot \mid A)=P(A \mid \cdot)$ -- somewhat confusing notation, but it is meant to indicate the likelihoods of two different unknown scenarios producing the data $A$.

$L(B \mid A)=0.85$

$L(B^C \mid A)=0.10$

When a woman has breast cancer, we are much more likely to get the data of a positive mammogram than we are when a woman is cancer-free.

. . . 

We can use the **likelihood function** to weigh the likelihoods of our data, a positive mammogram, under different cancer diagnosis scenarios. We can use it to 
update our probability that a person has cancer.

## Likelihood 

| Quantity | $B$ | $B^C$ | Sum |
|:-----|------:|------:|-----:|
| prior probability | 0.01 | 0.99 | 1 |
| likelihood | 0.85 | 0.10 | 0.95 |

Note the likelihood function is not a probability function, as it does not follow the **law of total probability** given by $P(B)+P(B^C)=1$. It provides a framework to evaluate the relative compatibility of our data (here, the positive mammogram) with the events $B$ and $B^C$.

. . . 

While the prior data suggests it is unlikely a 40 year old woman has breast cancer, the data provide evidence in favor of cancer diagnosis because $L(B \mid A) > L(B^C \mid A)$. We can use Bayes' rule to help us determine how likely a cancer diagnosis is given this evidence.

## Bayes' Rule

**Bayes' rule** gives us a formal way to update our beliefs based on new infomration.  It says $P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A \mid P(B)}{P(A)}=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}.$ Using our likelihoods, we can express this as $$P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)L(B \mid A)}{P(A)}.$$

Maya would like to know her chances of having cancer. Several papers have shown that even doctors strongly overestimate her chances of having cancer given the positive mammogram finding.

Recall **Law of Total Probability**:  $P(A)=P(A \cap B) + P(A \cap B^C)$ or, equivalently, $P(A)=P(A \mid B)P(B)+P(A \mid B^C)P(B^C)$.

## Calculations

$P(B) = \frac{100}{10000} = 0.01$

$P(A \mid B) = \frac{85}{100} = 0.85$ 

$P(A \mid B^C) = \frac{990}{9900} = 0.10$

$$P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)L(B \mid A)}{P(A \mid B)P(B)+P(A \mid B^C)P(B^C)}$$

. . . 

$$P(B \mid A) = \frac{0.01 \times 0.85 }{0.85 \times 0.01 + 0.10 \times 0.99}=0.079$$

## The Posterior Model


| Quantity | $B$ | $B^C$ | Sum |
|:-----|------:|------:|-----:|
| prior probability | 0.01 | 0.99 | 1 |
| likelihood | 0.85 | 0.10 | 0.95 |
| posterior probability | 0.079 | 0.921 | 1 |

## Summary

$$P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)L(B \mid A)}{P(A)}$$

$$ \text{posterior} = \frac{\text{prior} \times \text{likelihood}}{\text{marginal probability}}$$

$$ \text{posterior} = \frac{\text{prior} \times \text{likelihood}}{\text{normalizing constant}}$$
