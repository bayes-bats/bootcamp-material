# Introduction to Bayesian Statistics

## Bayesian Knowledge Building

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/bayes_diagram.png")
```

## Frequentist Knowledge Building

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center',out.width="10%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/freq_diagram.png")
```


## Balancing Act of Bayesian Analysis

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%"}

```

## Interpretation of Probability

**Bayesian**: a probability measures the relative plausibility of an event.

**Frequentist**: a probability measures the long-run relative frequency of a repeatable event. In fact, “frequentists” are so named because of their interpretation of probability as a long-run relative frequency.



## Prior Data

Consider two claims. 

(1) Kaya claims that they can predict the outcome of a coin flip. To test their claim, you flip a fair coin 10 times and they correctly predicts all 10! 

(2) Fan claims that they can distinguish natural and artificial sweeteners. To test their claim, you give them 10 sweetener samples and they correctly identify each! In light of these experiments, what do you conclude?

a. You’re more confident in Fan’s claim than Kaya’s claim.

b. The evidence supporting Kaya’s claim is just as strong as the evidence supporting Fan’s claim.



## Hypothesis Testing

Suppose that during a recent doctor’s visit, you tested positive for a very rare disease. If you only get to ask the doctor one question, which would it be?

a. What’s the chance that I actually have the disease?  
b. If in fact I don’t have the disease, what’s the chance that I would’ve gotten this positive test result?



a. $$P(\text{disease} | +)$$ 
b. $$P(+ | \text{disease}^c)$$



## Notes on Bayesian History

- Named after Thomas Bayes (1701-1761)


- Frequentist statistics is more popular; Bayesian statistics is surging in popularity 


- Computing, computing, computing


- It is harder to adopt to newer methods. Change is happening slowly. 



- We can embrace subjectivity.

# Review of Probability

## How good is a mammogram?

|         | Cancer | No Cancer | Total[^1] |
|---------|-------:|----------:|----------:|
| Mammo + | 85     |    990    |   1075   |
| Mammo - | 15     |   8910    |  8925   |
| Total   | 100    |     9900  |   10000    |
