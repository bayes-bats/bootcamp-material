## What Are You Teaching?

- Anything related to Bayesian methods

- It can be your plans

- Let's hear from 2-3 of you!

# Small Group Discussion

## Format and Length

- About 30 minutes

- 4 small groups, each led by one Instructor/TA

- Random assignment; get to know people from a different discipline!

- Assign a note-taker; if okay, please share notes with us afterwards

- Assign a reporter for large group sharing (3 minutes per group)

- Feel free to use our prepared questions and feel free to come up with your own


## Discussion Questions

1. Do you introduce Bayesian methods in your teaching, either as a module or as a standalone course? If so, what topics and at what levels? Do you follow a textbook? If not, what are your plans?

2. Do you have challenges with regards to pre-reqs? If so, do you have solutions?

3. Do you use certain software (other than R and Python and other programming languages) in your teaching? Do you have challenges with regards to Bayesian computing? If so, do you have solutions?

4. Do you include certain Bayesian modeling techniques in your teaching? Do you have challenges with regards to Bayesian modeling? If so, do you have solutions?

5. What is the one challenge you would like to get help with from BATS bootcamp?

# Large Group Sharing

## Format and Length

- About 25 minutes

- We will record this portion for sharing later. Okay?
